# 🎯 Perfect Guess Game

A fun and simple **command-line Python game** where you try to guess the correct number between 1 and 10. The game guides you by telling you if your guess is too high or too low — great for Python beginners!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The program randomly picks a number between 1 and 10.
- You get **unlimited tries** to guess the number.
- After each guess, it tells you whether to go **higher or lower**.
- Once correct, it displays the number of attempts you took.
